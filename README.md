# focusflow
### What is focusflow?
How do you organise your time? In-between meetings and deadlines, we often encounter issues keeping track and allocating what tasks we should do each day to make full use of our time. With just Google Calendar alone, creating events for specific tasks makes it difficult to plan meetings with other colleagues because our calendars will just be marked as ‘busy’. Hence, presenting focusflow, an all-in-one productivity application that aims to aid in time management, while celebrating the little successes achieved daily with you.
